# ML-Regression-Model
This repo covers the basic machine learning regression projects/problems using various techniques through scikit learn library 

# [Project 1 : Boston House Price Prediction ]
 * The file rgex1.ipynb was the very first attempt/beginner problem solution I worked on. It does basic linear regression through both statistics and ML techniques 
 * The file Boston_Housing_Price_ML.ipynb is the latest edition, applying complex functions  as I progressed through the intermediate and advanced training to the  very first regression problem which is the Boston House Price:  Using Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and      Multilayer Preceptron MLP Regressor to predict the median value of home.
